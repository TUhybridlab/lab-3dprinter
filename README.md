# 3D printer

Model: Anycubic i3 Mega
Manual: https://anycubic-i3-mega.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/Mega_Manual_V1.pdf
Upgrades: Heatbed adjusting knobs, Voltage Switch Cover

## Miniguide

- Design your model with your preferred software 
- Export it as a STL-File
- Slice it Cura to get a GCode-File
- Store it on printers SD-card
- Print it using printers UI 
  - Check for bed adhesion when the skirt gets printed and eventually do a Heat-Bed calibration. It is ok when the material doesn't stick the very beginning of the skirt, since it is not needed anyhow.
  
## CAD

There would be too much to write about

## Slic3r
 
### Cura

Cura has Anycubic i3 Mega settings already included

# Slic3r

Use the settings in printers manual for the setup.
  
## Heat-Bed calibration

The instructions in printers manual is ok for now.
